Previous Empirical Research\\nIn recent years, the intersection of blockchain technology and sustainable urban\\nmobility has emerged as a focal point for scholarly inquiry and practical application within\\nthe industry [1–3]. A considerable body of empirical research has sought to assess the\\nefficacy of blockchain-based solutions, particularly in enhancing security, transparency, and\\noperational efficiency across various domains. Despite the relatively nascent application of\\nblockchain technology in bike security, the existing literature on its applications provides a\\nrobust framework for understanding its potential benefits and inherent challenges [4–6].\\nThe initial scholarship concerning blockchain technology predominantly concentrated\\non its decentralised ledger system, highlighting the capacity of this technology to safeguard\\ntransactions against manipulation and fraud [7]. The foundational work of Nakamoto [8]\\nestablished the conceptual basis for blockchain by demonstrating its transformative poten-\\ntial for trust frameworks in digital transactions. Subsequent empirical analyses conducted\\nwithin the financial sector have corroborated that blockchain technology can significantly re-\\nduce transaction times and enhance security by eliminating the need for intermediaries [9].\\nThese seminal studies elucidate blockchain’s ability to provide real-time, tamper-proof data\\nverification, a characteristic of significant relevance for bike security [10].\\nBuilding upon these foundational studies, numerous researchers have explored the ap-\\nplication of blockchain in asset management and security [11,12]. A noteworthy corpus of\\nempirical research has scrutinised Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to establish digital owner-\\nship of physical assets. NFTs possess unique identifiers secured on a blockchain, producing\\nan immutable record of ownership and transactional history. Empirical demonstrations\\nin high-value asset markets, such as art and luxury goods, have shown that NFT-based\\nframeworks significantly enhance traceability while reducing incidents of fraud [13,14].\\nAlthough these investigations predominantly target premium asset categories, the underly-\\ning principles are inherently applicable to bicycle ownership. One may generate verifiable\\ndigital certificates to affirm ownership by tokenising bicycles as NFTs, deterring theft and\\nfraudulent claims [15].\\nFurthermore, the integration of QR codes with blockchain technology has emerged\\nas a promising approach for bridging the physical-digital divide [16]. Empirical studies\\nconducted within innovative city frameworks have examined QR code-based mechanisms\\nfor asset tracking and user authentication [17]. For instance, pilot initiatives in multiple\\nEuropean cities have successfully deployed QR codes to access blockchain-based records\\nacross various public services, encompassing ticketing systems and asset management\\napplications [18]. The findings from these studies consistently indicate that QR codes, when\\nintegrated with immutable blockchain records, significantly augment system transparency\\nand expedite verification processes [19]. An illustrative case is the recent initiative under-\\ntaken by the Belgian government, which sought to integrate QR codes with blockchain\\ntechnology for enhanced asset security [20] (Figure 2). This government-led innovation\\nbolstered data transparency and established a precedent for modernising security systems\\nwithin urban mobility contexts [21,22].\\nThe burgeoning research on bicycle security is advancing, with early empirical in-\\nvestigations yielding noteworthy findings.

Hypothesis Development and Research Gap\\nThis study’s innovation lies in combining behavioural insights from user surveys with\\neconometric modelling to reveal the connection between adopting sustainability-focused\\nbikes and the heightened theft risk. This area remains largely unexplored in current lit-\\nerature, despite escalating concerns in various cities about bicycle and e-bike vandalism\\nand theft, especially within bike-sharing systems [37]. The scale of this issue, posing a\\nwidespread public safety concern, warrants robust academic inquiry and policy interven-\\ntions aimed at integrating digital security technologies with urban mobility systems.\\nTo address this gap, the study employs a mixed-methods approach that merges quali-\\ntative data from user surveys with quantitative econometric analysis. This methodological\\nchoice is deliberate: behavioural data alone cannot uncover structural theft patterns, and\\nstatistical correlations may miss the lived experiences of cyclists. The integration of methods\\nthus allows for a richer, multidimensional understanding of how security concerns shape\\ncycling behaviours and perceptions, especially among users adopting environmentally\\nsustainable mobility options.\\nAdditionally, the study introduces a novel application of blockchain-based NFTs\\nand QR code technology to enable real-time verification of ownership in both urban and\\ntourism mobility contexts. While previous research has examined physical infrastruc-\\nture improvements, community-based interventions, and centralised registration systems,\\nthere remains limited attention to decentralised digital tools for immediate, secure proof\\nof ownership.\\nBuilding on the emerging literature on blockchain and digital trust in mobility, this\\nstudy proposes an innovative solution: a security framework that combines NFTs with QR\\ncodes to ensure traceable, privacy-respecting, and scalable bicycle ownership. Compared\\nto traditional systems, this approach empowers users, supports both individual and shared\\nfleets, and expands the technical scope of sustainable transport policy. Accordingly, the\\ncentral hypothesis asserts that failure to adopt blockchain-enabled verification systems\\nexacerbates perceptions of insecurity in cycling. Simultaneously, the rising volume of\\nbicycle sales intensifies the risk of theft.\\nH1. The increase in bicycle sales is positively associated with an increase in reported bicycle thefts\\nin Slovenia, indicating that higher adoption of sustainability-oriented mobility options increases\\nsecurity risks in the absence of advanced digital verification systems.\\n5. Results\\nThe findings of this study offer valuable insights into key aspects of bike safety, parking\\nlot availability, and the potential integration of QR code technology within blockchain-based\\nsecurity systems.

In this section, we will first present\\nthe findings related to bike safety and parking lot availability, followed by an overview of\\nthe relevant data and regression results concerning bike safety.

The distribution of responses revealed that 95 respondents (13%) rated the\\nstatement with a score of 1, 33 (5%) scored it as 2, 71 (10%) gave it a 3, 68 (10%) rated it 4,\\nand a significant 446 respondents (63%) awarded it the highest score of 5. The overall mean\\nrating for secure parking availability was approximately 4.0, with a standard deviation of\\n1.5 (Table 2).\\nThese findings suggest that while a substantial number of employees with access to\\nsecure parking feel confident about the safety of their bikes, considerable concerns persist\\namong those lacking adequate facilities. The fact that over 60% of respondents provided\\nthe highest rating highlights that when secure parking is available, it can significantly\\nenhance perceptions of safety. Nevertheless, the notable percentages of lower ratings\\nindicate existing gaps in infrastructure, which may lead to increased risks of bike theft or\\nvandalism among individuals without access to secure parking options.\\nThe results in Table 2 demonstrate that secure parking is a pivotal element in ensuring\\nbike safety. The high mean score among those with secure parking contrasts sharply\\nwith the lower scores given by respondents without adequate facilities, highlighting an\\ninfrastructure gap that could lead to increased security risks. These findings underscore\\nthe need for targeted investments in secure parking solutions to mitigate theft incidents\\nand enhance overall user confidence.\\n5.2. Beneficial Data on Bike Usage and Safety Indicators\\nBeyond parking, the survey collected data on bike usage patterns, shedding light\\non overall safety perceptions.\\nOne key question asked respondents about their fre-\\nquency of commuting by bike (Question 6). The distribution of responses was as follows:\\n118 respondents (14%) selected always, 79 (10%) chose regularly, at least 3 times per week,\\n46 (6%) answered occasionally, at least 2 times per week, 58 (7%) indicated at least once per\\nmonth, and a significant majority of 482 (59%) responded do not commute by bike.\\nIn addition to the frequency of use, bike ownership is a key indicator of safety. Ac-\\ncording to Question 9, of the 569 respondents (73%), 413 (73%) confirmed owning a bike\\nor e-bike (Figure 5), while 214 (26%) reported not owning one; a few responses remained\\nunanswered. Ownership is crucial, as it reflects current engagement with cycling and\\nindirectly influences perceptions of bike safety. Individuals who own bikes are more likely\\nto invest in security measures and perceive a greater need for secure infrastructure.\\nAlthough a complete regression analysis on bike safety was not explicitly performed\\nwith the survey dataset, the descriptive correlations suggest that secure parking and\\nfrequent use are linked to higher perceived safety. For example, while the proportion of\\nrespondents who commute by bike is relatively small (Figure 6), those who do generally\\nreport greater satisfaction with existing infrastructure and express a favourable outlook on\\nadditional security measures. This encouraging data highlights an opportunity: enhancing\\nsafety measures could potentially motivate more employees to adopt cycling as a mode\\nof transportation.\\nThe pie chart illustrates the frequency with which survey participants (n = 783) cycle\\nto work. A large majority (62%) indicated they do not use a bicycle for commuting. Of\\nthose who do, 15% responded with a general “yes” but did not clarify how often, while\\n10% cycle regularly (at least three times a week), 6% do so occasionally (at least twice a\\nweek), and 7% cycle rarely (at least once a month).\\nTable 3 illustrates the dual aspects of bike usage and safety perception. The com-\\nparatively low percentage of frequent cyclists, juxtaposed with a high bike ownership\\nrate, suggests that while many individuals are interested in cycling, a significant portion\\nremain hesitant due to insufficient safety measures.

Bicycle Theft and Sales: Regression Analysis\\nBeyond examining bike safety from an infrastructure standpoint, the study also inves-\\ntigated the connection between bicycle sales in Slovenia and the prevalence of bicycle theft.\\nPolice records indicate that, on average, 1814 bicycles are stolen annually in Slovenia.\\nWe conducted a regression analysis to determine whether an increase in bicycle sales—\\nand, consequently, a more significant number of bicycles in circulation—correlates with\\na rise in theft incidents. This analysis utilised annual bicycle sales data (measured in\\nthousands of units) as the independent variable and the yearly number of bicycle theft\\nincidents as the dependent variable. The regression model was designed as follows:\\nThe f tt = α + β1·BicycleSalest + β2·BicycleImportedt + ε,\\n(1)\\nIn this model, “Theft” refers to the total number of bicycle theft incidents reported\\nyearly, while “Bicycle Sales” denotes the annual number of new bicycles sold. Moreover, we\\nhave also added the data on bicycles imported in the equation. The econometric expression\\nindicates that the autocorrelation is resolved by first integrating the variables and then\\nconverting them using natural logarithms. The results suggest that the multiple regression\\nanalysis is not statistically significant. Conversely, the result of the bivariate regression\\nanalysis, based on ordinary least squares methods, is marginally significant.\\nThe estimated regression coefficient (β1) was determined to be 0.28 (p < 0.11), indicat-\\ning that for every additional 1000 bicycles sold, theft incidents are predicted to increase by\\napproximately 280. In practical terms, if annual sales rise by, for example, 10,000 units, the\\nmodel forecasts an increase of around 2800 theft incidents.\\nlnThe f tt = α + 0.28 t −1\\n(1, 63)\\n·lnBicycleSalest−1 + ε,\\n(2)\\nwhere the t-statistic is in parentheses.\\nIn contrast, bike imports generate a negative beta coefficient. This suggests that the\\nmore bikes are imported, the fewer bikes are likely to be stolen, but the beta coefficient is\\ninsignificant (p < 0.47).\\nlnThe f tt = α −0.43 t −1\\n(−0.75)\\n·lnBicycleImportedt + ε.\\n(3)\\nThe model’s R −squared value is 0.21, indicating that approximately 21% of the\\nvariance in annual theft incidents can be attributed to changes in the number of bicycles\\nsold. This high explanation of covariance underscores that as more bicycles are introduced\\ninto the market, the overall risk of theft increases, highlighting the urgent need for effective\\nsecurity measures. The regression analysis (2) thus provides compelling evidence in favour\\nof implementing technological advancements in bicycle security, such as blockchain-based\\nsystems combined with QR code verification. These cutting-edge solutions could effectively\\nenhance the tracking and protection of bicycles, potentially mitigating the elevated risk\\nassociated with higher sales volumes (Table 5).'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.25', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-07-10T15:23:25+08:00', 'source': 'data/pdf/BikeSecurity.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/pdf/BikeSecurity.pdf', 'total_pages': 20, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Sustainable Daily Mobility and Bike Security', 'author': 'Sergej Gričar, Christian Stipanović and Tea Baldigara', 'subject': 'As climate change concerns, urban congestion, and environmental degradation intensify, cities prioritise cycling as a sustainable transport option to reduce CO2 emissions and improve quality of life.

Discussion\\nThe findings of this study elucidate the significant role of secure bike parking and\\nenhanced bike security measures while also providing compelling insights when integrated\\nwith broader socioeconomic metrics such as tourism and sustainable development [40,41].\\nThe empirical data derived from survey results and regression analyses reveal a pronounced\\ncorrelation between secure parking infrastructure and the perceived safety of cycling, as\\nwell as a notable increase in theft incidents that correlates with a burgeoning market for\\nbicycle sales. This relationship between bike adoption and theft risk is explored in greater\\ndetail below.\\nThe hypothesis that increased bicycle sales are positively associated with higher theft\\nincidents is supported by the regression analysis results. Specifically, the model shows that\\nfor every 1000 additional bicycles sold, approximately 280 thefts occur, with a statistically\\nmarginal but meaningful significance (β = 0.28, p < 0.11). This positive correlation\\nconfirms that greater market penetration of bicycles—especially among sustainability-\\nconscious users—can expose systemic vulnerabilities if not accompanied by adequate\\nsecurity frameworks. These findings reinforce the need for proactive security strategies and\\nvalidate the study’s central argument: that rising adoption of cycling as a green mobility\\nsolution must be matched by the integration of scalable digital verification systems to\\npreserve public trust and prevent deterrents to sustainable transport behaviour.\\nA noteworthy dimension of this study is the potential nexus between bicycle security\\nand tourism [42,43].

Destinations incorporating secure bike systems underpinned by advanced tech-\\nnologies can effectively position these initiatives as integral to a comprehensive commit-\\nment to environmental sustainability and modern urban living. Contemporary tourists\\nexhibit a marked preference for environmentally-conscious travel options, making the\\navailability of a safe and secure bike network a compelling competitive advantage for cities\\nin Slovenia. This enriches the tourist experience and aligns with the country’s sustainable\\ndevelopment goals [47–50].\\nMoreover, qualitative feedback collected from the survey highlights a latent demand\\nfor digital security measures that transcend the current capabilities of physical infrastruc-\\nture. Although the survey did not specifically assess trust in blockchain-based security\\nsystems, the general safety concerns expressed by respondents and their openness to im-\\nproved digital tools suggest significant opportunities for further investigation. For instance,\\nimplementing a company-led initiative that integrates QR code technology with blockchain-\\nbased records could facilitate real-time verification of bike ownership and usage. Such a\\nsystem appeals to local commuters and tourists by streamlining administrative processes,\\nmitigating theft risk, and enhancing overall confidence in the bike ecosystem [51]. This\\nstudy introduces a set of network indicators to assess the impact of bike network features\\non bike kilometres travelled and bike–vehicle crashes, using data from Vancouver, Canada,\\nand Bayesian modelling to develop models that highlight associations between network\\ncharacteristics and biking outcomes.\\nFuture research endeavours should build upon these findings by examining the causal\\nrelationships between enhanced bike security, increased bike usage, and subsequent re-\\nductions in CO2 emissions. Longitudinal studies that monitor temporal changes would\\nbe invaluable in determining whether adopting secure, technology-driven bike systems\\nengenders measurable advancements in environmental sustainability. Additionally, in-\\nvestigations into the economic ramifications of these systems on tourism are warranted.\\nFor example, empirical studies could evaluate whether destinations with advanced bike\\nsystems experience higher tourist inflow and if these initiatives translate into increased\\nlocal economic activity. This line of inquiry could be further bolstered by developing a\\ncomprehensive regression model that amalgamates tourism metrics and CO2 emission data\\nto quantify both direct and indirect benefits of improved bike security.\\nFurthermore, future research could employ comparative analyses between cities that\\nimplement similar digital security measures and those that do not adopt such innova-\\ntions [52]. These comparisons would yield valuable insights into the efficacy of blockchain-\\nbased QR code systems in curbing theft rates and promoting sustainable mobility. Qualita-\\ntive studies centred on user experience and stakeholder perspectives would also enhance\\nthe understanding of public perceptions regarding these technological interventions and\\nidentify areas for improvement. Beyond blockchain and QR code verification, emerging\\ntechnologies such as decentralised identity (DID) systems, zero-knowledge proofs, and\\nInternet of Things (IoT)-based smart tracking present promising avenues for enhancing\\nbike security and privacy-respecting ownership verification [53].\\n7.

      " subject: As climate change concerns, urban congestion, and environmental degradation intensify, cities prioritise cycling as a sustainable transport option to reduce CO2 emissions and improve quality of life. However, rampant bicycle theft and poor security infrastructure often deter daily commuters and tourists from cycling. This study explores how advanced security measures can bolster sustainable urban mobility and tourism by addressing these challenges. A mixed-methods approach is utilised, incorporating primary survey data from Slovenia and secondary data on bicycle sales, imports and thefts from 2015 to 2024. Findings indicate that access to secure parking substantially enhances users’ sense of safety when commuting by bike. Regression analysis shows that for every 1000 additional bicycles sold, approximately 280 more thefts occur—equivalent to a 0.28 rise in reported thefts—highlighting a systemic vulnerability associated with sustainability-oriented behaviour. To bridge this gap, the study advocates for an innovative security framework that combines blockchain technology and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with encrypted Quick Response (QR) codes. Each bicycle would receive a tamper-proof QR code connected to a blockchain-verified NFT documenting ownership and usage data. This system facilitates real-time authentication, enhances traceability, deters theft, and builds trust in cycling as a dependable transport alternative. The proposed solution merges sustainable transport, digital identity, and urban security, presenting a scalable model for individual users and shared mobility systems.\n",
