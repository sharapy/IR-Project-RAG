Python Programming Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular
programming languages in the world.

Python has various levels, I learnt python using the book "Byte of Python" in 2012 on Python 2, though this was a fantastic book my use of python
remained confined to writing short scripts in DevOps and I never delved deeper in modular programming. With use of Jupyter notebooks its so different now. 
I remember one of my old scripts where I would take decisions based on IP address structure, where the logic behind each octet was different. I used python extensively on
DELL iDRAC project to write a lot of middleware in Python, that used other libraries written in C to communicate with hardware. 
With ML the use of Python has skyrocketted, Its like in this decade I am learning it all over again offcourse with new modules. 

Key Features:
- Easy to learn and use
- Extensive standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Strong community support

Python is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation.
