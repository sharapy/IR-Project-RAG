Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve
from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs
that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Is machine learnig we see today example of TRUE AI? it seems like GAI would be the true aspect of AI where AI will actually be learning. 


Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through rewards and penalties

Applications include image recognition, speech processing, and recommendation systems
