Practice emergency braking drills in a safe, open area.
If you stop at a light, stand where drivers in the queue can see you easily.
Understand how Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) can be used to combine retrieval results (Note: This is an example of a related technical error/query in a RAG system and is included for dataset diversity, but is not a bicycle tip).
Carry a small first-aid kit for minor injuries.
Be wary of car turning signals; wait until the car actually turns before proceeding.
Use your highest gear when stopping to make starting easier.
Check your tires for embedded glass or sharp debris after every ride.
